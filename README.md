# houseprices_regression
Build a predictive model to predict sale price of houses and evaluate the already existing predictions in the dataset

- Code written in Python on Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset is in csv format with following columns:
●	PropertyID: Unique ID for home 
●	TransDate: Date of current sale 
●	SaleDollarCnt: Price of current sale 
●	BathroomCnt: Number of bathrooms in home 
●	BedroomCnt: Number of bedrooms in home
●	BuiltYear: Year home was constructed 
●	FinishedSquarefeet: Finished square footage of the home 
●	GarageSquareFeet: Size of protected garage space if any
●	LotsizeSquarefeet: Lot size of property in square feet 
●	StoryCnt: Number of stories for the home 
●	latitude: Latitude of the home * 1,000,000 
●	longitude: Longitude of the home * 1,000,000 
●	Usecode: Type of home (all homes in both training and test are single-family homes) 
●	ZoneCodeCounty: The intensity of use or density the lot is legally allowed to be built-up to
●	viewtypeid: Nominal variable indicating the type of view from the home (blank or NULL value indicates no view)
●	censusblockgroup: The FIPS code for the census block group this property is located in.  You can derive the census tract FIPS by truncating the rightmost digit.
●	BGMedHomeValue: The median home value in the block group      
●	BGMedRent:  The median rent value in the block group           
●	BGMedYearBuilt:  The median year structures in the block group were built
●	BGPctOwn:  Percentage of homes that are owner-occupied in the block group
●	BGPctVacant:  Percentage of housing that is vacant in the block group         
●	BGMedIncome:  Median income of households residing in the block group         
●	BGPctKids:  Percentage of households with children under 18 years present at home          
●	BGMedAge:  Median age of residents of the block group
●	Prediction: Your Colleague’s model’s prediction of value

The methodology, results and conclusion are in the word document. This was a challenge as an interview process, thus dataset will not be shared.
